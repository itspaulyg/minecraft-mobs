# minecraft-mobs
Minecraft Mob Wiki written in Go

## Background
This project is designed to take a step back from all the common programming languages we have learned about and explore a non-traditional programming language. We choose Go as ours and will implement a basic web application that will be hosted on Heroku, so as to utilize the Cloud.
We are developing a Mob Wiki for the classic game Minecraft. This wiki will show basic information such as health, spawn info, and items dropped, related to various mobs in the game.
